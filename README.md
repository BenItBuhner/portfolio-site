# Overview

This is my portfolio site! Built on top of Next.js, CSS, and TypeScript, with the help of the Figma MCP server to get some styling and assets imported quickly. This is very rough and still in the works, but since I see no reason to keep it private, I'm putting it here for all to see! 

# Installing & Running

You can adapt it as you want (such as to use Bun or make it your own), but to run it, I used "npm."

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Easy as that!
